# AnyAgent — AI Agent Platform

An AI agent platform built from scratch with a build-in-public approach.

## The Journey

Built AnyAgent transparently, sharing progress, challenges, and technical decisions with the community. This open approach attracted attention from the AI ecosystem.

## Outcome

## Key Learnings

- **Build in public**: Transparency creates trust and opportunities
- **Product-market fit**: Validating ideas early saves months of wasted effort
- **Community**: Building relationships in the AI space opens doors

## Technologies
