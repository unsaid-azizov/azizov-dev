# Lezghian ML Community

Founded an international community of ML enthusiasts and linguists dedicated to preserving the Lezghian language through modern AI technologies.

## Mission

Create accessible tools and resources that preserve and advance the Lezghian language — an endangered language spoken by ~800,000 people — using state-of-the-art AI.

## What We Built

### Russian ↔ Lezghian Translator
Fine-tuned NLLB-200-distilled-600M model for accurate translation between Russian and Lezghian. Available as a Telegram bot (@lek_translator_bot) for everyday use by native speakers.

### Lezghian TTS (Text-to-Speech)
Trained a VITS-based TTS model to generate natural Lezghian speech from text. One of the first TTS systems for the Lezghian language.

### Language Corpus & Datasets
Assembled the largest open Lezghian language corpus with a team of 16 volunteers:

| Dataset | Size | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Bible (Lezghian-Russian) | 13.8K parallel sentences | Largest parallel corpus |
| Lezgi Gazet Archives | 402 articles | News articles corpus |
| CNAL Lezghian-Russian | 762 entries | Literary translations |
| Lez Wiki | 4.4K articles | Wikipedia dump |
| Secret of Third Planet | 361 entries | Children's book translation |

### Multilingual Embeddings
Fine-tuned multilingual-e5-large and LaBSE models for Lezghian language understanding and semantic search.

## Impact

- First open-source NLP toolkit for the Lezghian language
- 16 active community members and growing
- Telegram bot used by native speakers daily
- Contributing to digital preservation of an endangered language
- All models and datasets freely available on HuggingFace

## Technologies

Python, PyTorch, HuggingFace Transformers, NLLB, VITS, LaBSE, mT5
