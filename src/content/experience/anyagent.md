Founded AnyAgent — an AI agent platform. Built the product in public, sharing the journey and technical decisions openly.

The build-in-public approach attracted attention from the AI community and directly led to an invitation to join Skygen.ai as a Senior AI Engineer — without a formal interview.

## Key Learnings

- Product-market fit exploration in the AI agent space
- Building and shipping fast with limited resources
- Community building through transparent development
- The power of building in public for career opportunities
