# About Me

I'm the **Founder of an AI automation agency**, helping businesses transform through AI Agents and voice automation. My background in deep AI/ML work (Kandinsky, X-FLUX) gives me the technical depth to build solutions that actually work.

## From AI Research to Business Automation

**My Journey:**
Started in AI/ML research and open-source:
- **Sberbank (SberAI)** — Worked on Kandinsky diffusion model (one of leading Russian AI models)
- **XLabs AI** — Built X-FLUX ecosystem (4K+ GitHub stars, 1M+ downloads, used by Disney/Netflix creators)
- **Deforum-Kandinsky** — Created text-to-video pipeline (1,000+ content creators)

**Realized**: The real value of AI is in solving business problems, not just research papers.

**Transitioned** to business automation:
- Founded **AnyAgent** platform (built in public)
- Now run **AI automation agency** helping real businesses
- In parallel: **Senior AI Developer at Skygen.ai**

## What I Do Now

**Services:**

- Custom AI consulting and integrations

**Clients:**
- Infobiz (course creators, coaches, consultants)
- E-commerce and retail
- Service businesses

**My Approach:** I understand AI deeply (not just chatbots) — so I can build systems that actually work and create ROI, not just demos.

## Technical Stack
