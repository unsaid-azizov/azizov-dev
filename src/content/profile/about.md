# About Me

I'm an **AI Engineer** with deep expertise in diffusion models, computer vision, and practical AI implementation for business.

## My Journey

### Diffusion Models & Open Source

Started at **Sberbank (SberAI)** where I worked on **Kandinsky** — one of the leading Russian diffusion models. Built the **Deforum-Kandinsky** pipeline for text-to-video generation, adopted by 1,000+ content creators.

Moved to **XLabs AI** as Senior ML Engineer where I became a core contributor to the **X-FLUX ecosystem** — the industry standard for FLUX model integration:
- 4,000+ GitHub stars combined
- 1M+ downloads across HuggingFace, CivitAI, and GitHub
- Used by Disney, Netflix content creators
- 50% VRAM reduction (24GB → 12GB)

### Startups & Agency

Founded **AnyAgent** — an AI agent platform built in public. The build-in-public journey led to my current role at **Skygen.ai** where I was invited without an interview.

Founded an **AI automation agency** helping businesses:
- Optimize processes through AI automation
- Build MVPs with AI integration
- Deploy voice agents and AI chatbots
- Implement custom AI solutions
