Very happy with our AI Voice Agent developed by @simonbalfe and @said_azizov. They've gone above and beyond to create something which handles all of our inbound calls, exceptionally well. Yesterday alone, whilst on holiday, the agent helped me to capture a £1,200/$1,365 lead which we've now converted. With every tweak it only seems to be getting better too.
