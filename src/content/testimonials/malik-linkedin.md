Last year we worked on an AI-based calorie and macros tracking project Yastvo AI. At some point we realized we needed to add a nutritionist chat, so users could get recommendations and close specific questions inside the product. I brought Said Azizov in as the ML specialist. I already knew him from a couple of projects he had been part of. He got involved fast, went through the docs, collected all requirements, and designed a multi-agent system tailored to our case. During implementation he also built an n8n prototype and guided our team while we were shipping this feature. I'm really glad I chose Said. We delivered the functionality, and I'm genuinely happy I reached out to him.
