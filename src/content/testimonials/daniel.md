I had the pleasure of working side by side with Said during his time as a CV Engineer at XLabs AI, and I can confidently say he's one of the most professional and capable engineers I've worked with. He played a key role in training and releasing state-of-the-art FLUX models, including the first-in-the-world FLUX LoRA. What impressed me most was not just the technical depth, but how fast and reliably he delivered production-ready results. Beyond the engineering excellence, he was professional in every sense: clear communicator, extremely organized, and always focused on getting things done the right way. Any team working on diffusion models, generative vision, or applied AI would be lucky to have him.
